/* When hiding e.g. a modal using the opacity attribute, it is always part of the DOM.
   Negative: 
    - the DOM is bloated -> slightly worse performance
    - bad accessibility

   Instead the react-transition-group library can be used. It does not have the best typescript support (types missing) so adding it needs additional steps.
      - install react-transition-group
      - install the types for it (e.g. @types/react-transition-group": "^4.4.6")
      - import the Transition component like this: import { Transition } from "react-transition-group";

   The Transition component
      - has four states:
         - entering
         - entered
         - exiting
         - exited
      
      - takes two attributes:
         - in (boolean): should the children be rendered/visible or not
         - timeout (milliseconds): how long should it take to switch from entering to entered and from exiting to exited
