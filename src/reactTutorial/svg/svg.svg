<!-- Paths:
    svg paths can be defined the following, adding a "d" attribute:
        <path d="M10 10 L75 10 L75 75 Z" />
            M: Put the pen down, e.g. M10 10 -> at 10/10
            L: Draw a line to a certain point, e.g. L75/10 -> draw to 75/10
            Z: Close the path by returning to the starting point

            More complex shapes can created using:
                A: Arcs
                Q: Quadratic bezier curves
                C: Cubic bezier curves

                e.g. <path d="M10 80 Q 77.5 10, 145 80 T 280 80" fill="transparent" stroke="#000000" stroke-width="5"></path> -->

<!-- Color:
- "currentColor" can be addressed by the "color" attribute and can be set for fill or stroke.
- "current" for fill can be addressed by the "fill" attribute, if you want to distinguish between fill and stroke.
- "current" for stroke can be addressed by the "stroke" attribute -->
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path fill="currentColor" stroke="currentColor" d="M10 10 L75 10 L75 75 Z"/>
    <path fill="current" stroke="current" d="M10 10 L75 10 L75 75 Z"/>
