/* The default position for an element is "static" which means that it is part of the document flow.
   Setting the position to "fixed" means it is taken out of the document flow and is positioned where it is defined (e.g. top/left)

   Fixed/absolute: take an element out of the document flow. They are positioned as follows:
        - fixed: the positioning context is the viewport (e.g. "top:0" results in the element to be right at the top)
        - absolute: the positioning context depends
	                    - when no ancestor has a position-property set, the positioning context is the html-element 
                          (e.g. "top:0" results in the element to be at the top of the html-element)
	                    - when ancestors have a position-property set, the positioning context is applied from the closest element that has a position-property set.
		                  For this to work, some ancestor should have the "position: relative" property
