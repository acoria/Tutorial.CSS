/*
    There are four types of combinators:
        For the same level:
        - adjacent sibling
        - general sibling
        For elements inside elements:
        - child
        - descendant

    Specificity:
    - All combinators have the same priority regarding specificity,
      so the last combinator defined in the CSS wins.
    - More specific combinators win over less specific ones
    e.g. li + li + li wins over ol > li

    For performance reasons it is best to only use classes and ids as selectors
        e.g. 
            #someId h1{ }
            .someClass p{ }
