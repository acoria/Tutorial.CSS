/* Media queries in combination with the meta-tag "viewport" allow for the site layout to be changed depending on certain conditions.
    
Best practices:
   - Design "mobile first" and then adjust the layout for the desktop page with the media queries.
   - Add media queries to the bottom of the css.
   - Check https://www.mydevice.io/ for the usual device sizes to support.
