/*
    CSS rules consist of the following elements:
        - selectors (e.g. div, .class, #id)
        - properties (e.g. background-color, margin, width)
        - values (e.g. red, 10px, 30%)

    Properties are listed here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

    Best practices:
        - Put the more general rules at the top and go down to more specific rules
