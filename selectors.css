/*  Selectors: there are five types of selectors
        - element
        - class
        - id
        - tag
        - universal

    Inheritance: each element inherits the styles of its parents but as soon as there is a selector, this overrides the inherited style.
    Cascading: multiple rules can apply to the same element
    Specificity: resolves conflicting styles for the same element
    
    Order of specificity priority (highest to lowest):
        - inline styles
        - #ID selectors
        - .class, :pseudo-class and [attribute] selectors
        - <tag> and ::pseudo-element selectors
        - * universal selector
        - inheritance
