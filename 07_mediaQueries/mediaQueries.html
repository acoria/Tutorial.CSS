         It adjusts the site to device's viewport by converting the "hardware pixels" to "software pixels". 
         Without it, the side is shown with the width/height that it would if you look at it on a normal screen
         and the site gets squeezed in tiny on the screen.
         initial-scale=1.0 is the default zoom -->
