/* Pay attention to unexpected inline-block behavior! 
   When you have line breaks in your html, the space between them is considered to be an element,
   so sometimes your elements will not be in the same line.
   e.g.
   </div>
   <nav>

   To fix this, put them next to each other or leave more space by subtracting more space from one
